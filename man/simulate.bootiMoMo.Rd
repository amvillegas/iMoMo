Rate Model}
\usage{
\method{simulate}{bootiMoMo}(
  object,
  nsim = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  h = 50,
  kt.order = c(1, 0, 0),
  kt.include.constant = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{"bootiMoMo"} with the bootstrapped
parameters of an improvement rate model.}

\item{nsim}{number of sample paths to simulate from each bootstrapped
sample. Thus if there are \code{nBoot} bootstrapped samples the total
number of paths will be \code{nsim * nBoot}.}

\item{seed}{either \code{NULL} or an integer that will be used in a
call to \code{\link{set.seed}} before simulating the time series.
The default, \code{NULL} will not change the random generator state.}

\item{h}{number of years ahead to forecast.}

\item{kt.order}{an optional vector indicating the order of
autorregression and of differetiation of the VARI model. The two
components \eqn{(p, d)} are the AR order and the degree of  differencing.}

\item{kt.include.constant}{a logical value indicating if the VARI model
should include a constant value. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{kt.include.trend}{a logical value indicating if the VARI model
should have a linear trend. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{gc.order}{a specification of the ARIMA model for the cohort effect:
the three components \eqn{(p, d, q)} are the AR order, the degree of
differencing, and the MA. The default is an ARIMA\eqn{(1, 0, 0)}.}

\item{gc.include.constant}{a logical value indicating if the ARIMA model
should include a constant value. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{jumpRates}{optional vector of moratlity rates for the last year used as starting rates.
for the projection. If it is not provided the rates from the  the actual rates from
the final year are used.}

\item{kt.lookback}{optional argument to specify the look-back window to use
in the estimation of the time series model for the period indexes. By
default all the estimated values are used. If
\code{kt.lookback} is provided then the last \code{kt.lookback}
years of \eqn{\kappa_t^{(i)}, i = 1,..N,} are used.}

\item{gc.lookback}{optional argument to specify the look-back window to use
in the estimation of the ARIMA model for the cohort effect. By
default all the estimated values are used in estimating the ARIMA
model. If \code{gc.lookback} is provided then the last
\code{gc.lookback} years of \eqn{\gamma_{t-x}} are used.}

\item{...}{other arguments.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"simiMoMo"} with components:

\item{improvements}{a three dimensional array with the future simulated improvement rates.}
\item{rates}{a three dimensional array with the future simulated mortality rates.}
\item{ages}{vector of ages corresponding to the first dimension of \code{improvements}.}
\item{years}{vector of years for which a forecast has been produced. This
 corresponds to the second dimension of \code{improvements}.}#'
\item{kt.s}{ information on the simulated paths of the period indexes of the model.
This is a list with the \code{model} fitted to \eqn{\kappa_t}; the simulated paths
\code{sim}; and the \code{years} for which a forecast was produced. If the
model does not have any age-period terms (i.e. \eqn{N=0}) this is set to
\code{NULL}.}
\item{gc.s}{ information on the simulated paths of the cohort index of
the model. This is a list with the \code{model} fitted to \eqn{\gamma_c};
the simulated paths (\code{sim}); and the \code{cohorts} for which
simulations were produced. If the mortality model does not have a cohort
effect this is set to \code{NULL}.}
\item{fittedImprovements}{ a three dimensional array with the in-sample
improvements of the model for the years for which the improvement rate model
was fitted.}
}
\description{
Simulate mortaility improvment rates and mortality rates using
the a bootstrapped a mortality improvement rate model.
The period indexes are \eqn{\kappa_t^{(i)}, i = 1,..N,} are forecasted
using integrated vector autoregressive model. The cohort index
\eqn{\gamma_{t-x}} is forecasted using an ARIMA\eqn{(p, d, q)}.
By default an ARIMA\eqn{(1, 1, 0)} with a constant is used.
